# TO GET THE OAuth LOGIN
Step-by-Step: Get Your Google OAuth Client Secrets File
1. Go to the Google Cloud Console
Visit https://console.cloud.google.com and log in with your Google account.

2. Create or Select an Existing Project
At the top, click on the project drop-down and select an existing project or click "New Project" to create one.

Give it a name and (optionally) select an organization.

3. Enable the Google Drive API
In your project, search for "APIs & Services" > "Library".

Search for “Google Drive API” and click on it.

Click “Enable”.

4. Create OAuth Consent Screen
Go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen".

Choose "External" or "Internal" user type, depending on your needs.

Fill in the required fields (App name, user support email, developer contact email).

In "Scopes", add .../auth/drive.file (drive access limited to files your app creates/opens).

In "Test Users", add the Gmail addresses you’ll use for testing (if app type is "External" and app not published).

5. Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID
Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".

Click “Create Credentials” > “OAuth client ID”.

Choose "Desktop app" as the application type (for development/testing with local Streamlit apps).

If you're deploying on the web, select "Web application" and fill in "Authorized redirect URIs" (e.g., http://localhost:8501/, http://127.0.0.1:8080/).

Give it a name and create.

6. Download the Client Secret JSON
After creation, you’ll see your client listed. Click the download icon to download the client_secret_....json file.

This file will often be named like client_secret_XXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com.json.

Save it in the same directory as your code (or reference its path correctly).

7. Use the File in Your Code
